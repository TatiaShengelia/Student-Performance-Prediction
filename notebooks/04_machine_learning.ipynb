    "**1. Linear Regression (Predicting Final Grades `G3`)**\n",
    "- Linear Regression is simple and interpretable regression model, ideal for predicting continuous outcomes like final grades.\n",
    "- It quantifies the relationship between features and the target using coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Decision Tree Classifier (Predicting Pass/Fail)**\n",
    "- Decision Trees can capture nonlinear relationships between features and the binary target (pass/fail).\n",
    "- It's easy to visualize and interpret, and shows which features most effectively split the data for predicting success.\n",
    "- Handles mixed feature types (numeric + categorical) without extensive preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Logistic Regression (Predicting Pass/Fail)**\n",
    "- Logistic Regression is standard model for binary classification, predicting the probability of passing or failing.\n",
    "- Coefficients provide interpretable insights into how each feature affects the likelihood of passing."

    "## Model Comparison and Performance Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Linear Regression (Predicting Final Grade G3)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R<sup>2</sup> = 0.127** - This means the features explain only about 12.7% of the variance in final grades.\n",
    "- **MSE = 17.895** - The model has a relatively high error in predicting the final grade.\n",
    "- Conclusion: Linear Regression is not good for predicting final grades in this dataset. The low R<sup>2</sup> means that either the chosen features aren't necessary responsible for G3, or student grades are influenced by other factors that's not in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Decision Tree Classifier (Pass/Fail Prediction)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy = 0.684, Precision = 0.729, Recall = 0.827\n",
    "- The Decision Tree performs reasonably well but has false positives (classifies some failing students as passing).\n",
    "- Confusion Matrix shows a moderate number of misclassifications: [[11, 16], [9, 43]]\n",
    "- Conclusion: The model captures patterns for pass/fail outcomes but is less consistent than Logistic Regression in terms of overall performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Logistic Regression (Pass/Fail Prediction)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy = 0.747, Precision = 0.742, Recall = 0.942\n",
    "- Confusion Matrix:[[10, 17], [3, 49]]\n",
    "- Conclusion: Logistic Regression performs the best overall for pass/fail classification. It has high recall (0.942), so based on that it correctly identifies most students who pass. Slightly lower precision shows a few false positives, but overall it is more consistent than the Decision Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which Model Performs Better?\n",
    "\n",
    "- For regression: Linear Regression is weak (low R<sup>2</sup>), so it does not predict final grades accurately.\n",
    "- For classification: Logistic Regression is better than Decision Tree in predicting pass/fail outcomes which is shown by higher accuracy and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors Influencing Student Success\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **From the models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key predictors for final grades (G3) include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Study time** - More study time tends to correlate with higher grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Failures** - Past failures negatively affect final grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parental education** - Higher parental education levels are associated with better student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alcohol consumption** - Higher alcohol use may negatively impact grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification pass/fail prediction shows that:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sex and study-related features** are important for predicting success.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression shows that behavioral and academic features combined are pretty good for predicting which students pass."
